# Clean Code: FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a basic screening question used to filter job candidates who cannot code. However, even a coding question as simple as FizzBuzz can serve as a great example of how to write clean code, not just working code.

In a [Jupyter notebook](FizzBuzz.ipynb), we provide two solutions to FizzBuzz: a normal solution and a clean solution. We then analyze the clean solution to see why clean code matters&mdash;both for more complex coding questions and for real-life projects.
